Hello! I am Nguyen (Nick) Nguyen, a Ph.D. candidate in `Marketing` at the `University of Miami`. Previously, I received my B.S. *magna cum laude* in `Computer Science, minor in Mathematics` from the `University of Miami`.

In my mainstream research, I have developed AI systems for “Content Management: The Modern Pipeline of Generating, Selecting, and Targeting Ads”:

[`EMOP (Email Open Rate Predictor)`](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mksc.2021.0126) is an AI system that helps marketers optimize email marketing campaigns. Specifically, EMOP can predict email open rates of email campaigns based on email headlines, recipients' characteristics, and sending time. Using EMOP, marketers can test unlimitedly different versions of email campaigns, thus identifying the optimal version to launch.

`DeepAudio` is an AI system that assesses the likeability of audio ads. Nowadays, marketers can use generative AI to generate numerous audio ad executions. Also, they can use ad targeting platforms such as Spotify to deliver audio ads to targeted audiences. However, marketers currently lack an easy method to evaluate the effectiveness of their audio ads. By quickly assessing the likeability of multiple audio ads, DeepAudio enables marketers to select the most promising ad executions and fully harness the power of Generative AI. Thus, DeepAudio completes the modern pipeline of generating, selecting, and targeting audio ads.
