Hello! I am a Ph.D. candidate in `Marketing` at the `University of Miami`. Previously, I received my B.S. *magna cum laude* in `Computer Science and minor in Mathematics` from the `University of Miami`.

My primary research focuses on developing AI systems for "Content Management" as outlined in the papers below:

[`EMOP (Email Open Rate Predictor)`](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mksc.2021.0126) is an AI system that helps marketers optimize email marketing campaigns. Specifically, EMOP can predict the open rate of a given email campaign based on its email headline, recipients, and sending time. Using EMOP, marketers can test unlimitedly different versions of email campaigns, thus identifying the optimal version to launch.

`DeepAudio` is an AI system that assesses the likeability of audio ads. Nowadays, marketers can use generative AI to generate numerous audio ad executions and use ad-targeting platforms such as Spotify to deliver audio ads to targeted audiences. However, marketers currently lack an easy method to evaluate the effectiveness of their audio ads. By quickly assessing the likeability of multiple audio ads, DeepAudio enables marketers to select the most promising ad executions and fully harness the power of Generative AI. Thus, DeepAudio completes the modern pipeline of generating, selecting, and targeting audio ads.
