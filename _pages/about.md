Hello! I am Nguyen (Nick) Nguyen, a Ph.D. candidate in `Marketing` at the `University of Miami`. Previously, I received my B.S. *magna cum laude* in `Computer Science, minor in Mathematics` from the `University of Miami`.

In my mainstream research, I have developed AI systems for “Content Management: The Modern Pipeline of Generating, Selecting, and Targeting Ads”: 

`EMOP (Email Open Rate Predictor)` is an AI system that helps marketers optimize email marketing campaigns. Specifically, EMOP can predict email open rates of email campaigns based on email headlines, recipients' characteristics, and sending time. Using EMOP, marketers can test unlimitedly different versions of email campaigns, thus identifying the optimal version to launch.

`DeepAudio` is an AI system that assesses the likeability of audio ads. We build DeepAudio by integrating domain knowledge from consumer behavior research with computer science deep learning algorithms. DeepAudio enables marketers to select the most promising ad executions generated by Generative AI and target them to specific audiences.
