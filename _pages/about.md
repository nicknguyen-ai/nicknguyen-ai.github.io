Nguyen Nguyen’s research focuses on developing AI systems for content management in marketing. His work centers on building interpretable and scalable machine learning models that analyze unstructured data—such as email headlines and audio ads—to support more effective creative and campaign decisions. These AI systems aim to enhance marketers’ ability to generate, evaluate, and select high-performing content at scale.

He has developed [`EMOP (Email Open Rate Predictor)`](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/mksc.2021.0126), an AI system that forecasts the open rate of email campaigns based on subject lines, audience characteristics, and sending times. As an alternative to traditional A/B testing, EMOP empowers marketers to test unlimited campaign variations and identify the most effective version to launch.
